# Sabotage Linux

This is Sabotage, an experimental distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

Currently Sabotage supports i386, x86_64, MIPS, PowerPC32 and ARM(v4t+).
ARM hardfloat (hf) is supported via crosscompilation of stage1,
since it requires a recent GCC which we can't easily bootstrap in stage0 due
to library dependencies of GCC introduced with 4.3.

The preferred way to build Sabotage is using a native Linux environment for
the desired architecture.
It is now also possible to cross-compile large parts of it.
As cross-compiling is hairy and support for it is quite new, expect breakage.
Native builds are well tested and considered stable.


## Requirements:

* ~4G free disk space.
* A Linux 3.8+ host kernel with USER_NS support, for entering native chroots
  without root.
* A Linux 2.6+ host kernel can be used, but requires root access.
* A `gcc` 4.x tool chain.
* `git`, to check out the repository.
* `bzip2`, `sed`, `patch`, `tar`, `wc`, `wget` and `xz` are needed to run the
  build script.
* Lots of time and a fair bit of Linux knowledge.


## Cross-Compile Requirements:

* `musl-cross` for your target arch.
* `butch` installed for the build host in $PATH
   (since it lives in KEEP/bin, adding that to $PATH will also do).
* `pkgconf` symlinked as pkg-config in $PATH, before other pkg-config versions.
  a standard `pkg-config` installed on the host may also work, but is untested.
* Packages may have a `deps.host` section listing further packages required on
  the host.

The only tested cross-compile setup is a Sabotage host that has the same
packages installed as the ones you wish to compile.

This system has built *natively* on Debian 6 & 7, Fedora 18 & 21, Ubuntu 14.04,
openSUSE 13.2, Alpine 3.1.2 and Void Linux.

## Obtaining Sabotage

You can bootstrap your own build from the scripts at:

https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage

Download ready-to-boot QEMU/VirtualBox disk images that you may also extract
the rootfs from:

* DE : http://ftp.barfooze.de/pub/sabotage/
* GR : http://foss.aueb.gr/mirrors/linux/sabotage/
* UK : http://dl.2f30.org/mirrors/sabotage/
* FR : http://mirrors.2f30.org/sabotage/ 

The DE mirror is the master from which the other mirrors are periodically
synced.

SHA512 checksums for releases get posted on the mailing lists, archived here:

**READ THE COOKBOOK FIRST BEFORE POSTING**.


## Native Build Instructions:

**DO NOT RUN SCRIPTS YOU HAVE NOT READ**.

	$ cp KEEP/config.stage0 config
	$ vi config

Set the `SABOTAGE_BUILDDIR`, `A`, and `MAKE_THREADS` variables.
You may usually ignore the other values.
Both the config file and the COOKBOOK cover the meaning of these variables.

Enable `SUPER` to use the following `./enter-chroot` script without root.

NOTE: It is possible to build an i386 Sabotage from within an existing 32-bit
chroot on a 64-bit system.
The `enter-chroot` script automatically handles this scenario.

	$ ./build-stage0        # ~2min on an AMD FX 8core, 75min on ARM Cortex A8 800Mhz
	$ ./enter-chroot

Once inside the chroot, you may decide between installing `stage1` or `stage2`:

	$ butch install stage1	# Installs core system + build chain
	$ butch install stage2  # Installs stage1 + libressl

If `libressl` is present, `wget` will be HTTPS-enabled.
This will allow butch to download packages via HTTPS protocol.

Older pre-3.8 Linux systems will not support the rootless chroot approach used
by `./enter-chroot`.
Disable `SUPER` and run `./enter-chroot` as root if you encounter an issue.

Once completed, you may install optional packages:

	$ butch install core    # installs a sane subset for a developer base system
	$ butch install xorg    # install everything needed for xfbdev
	$ butch install pkg     # things such as file, git, gdb ...
	$ butch install world   # almost everything

You may list available packages by using `ls /src/pkg`.

If you wish to build the default kernel:

	$ butch install kernel

Run `butch` and look at the usage information for further options.

`butch` uses build templates that allow for a high level of customization.
`KEEP/butch_template_configure_cached.txt` is the base template used by Sabotage.
It provides a tuned `config.cache` for faster configure runs.
It also installs packages into `/opt`, creates file lists, etc.


## Cross-Compile Instructions:

	$ cp KEEP/config.cross .
	$ vi config.cross # set your vars
	$ A=microblaze CONFIG=./config.cross utils/setup-rootfs.sh # initialize rootfs
	$ A=microblaze CONFIG=./config.cross butch install nano # start building stuff

Much like a native build, a config file is copied and edited.
`utils/setup-rootfs.sh` is run instead of `./build-stage0` to construct the
new root.
Finally, we use `butch` to start cross-compiling and installing packages into it.

## After Compiling

When finished compiling, exit the chroot and either:

* Use the rootfs directly, by copying it to some disk.
* Use `utils/run-emulator.sh` to boot the system in QEMU.
  Running in QEMU has poor HDD performance, as the FS is mounted via 9P protocol.
  It's not recommended for building packages, but it's practical for testing.
* Use `utils/write-hd-image.sh` to create an image file.
  The image file boots in QEMU.
  To convert it into VirtualBox format use `VBoxManage convertfromraw`.


## RUNNING SABOTAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME

The default root password is "sabotage".

Start the sshd service using `sv u sshd`, which will create keys on first use.
To make the service autostart on boot, remove `/etc/service/sshd/down`.

Edit `/etc/rc.local` for other things to autostart, such as network
configuration, DHCP, console keymapping...

If you have X installed, edit the example `/bin/X` for the correct evdev
settings, then run `startx`.
Check `/etc/xinitrc` for X11 keyboard configuration.


## NOTES TO CONTRIBUTORS

Please use unified `diff` format (`diff -u`) for patches.

### Use Git

It is necessary that you create `git` branches for your work.
This allows your changes to be checked out and rebased as needed, without merge
conflicts.

Do not commit more than one change/package in a single commit.
Use a meaningful commit message that mentions the package name.
Please follow the style and conventions of your fellow contributors.

### Use Templates

When creating packages, try starting from the autoconf template:

	$ cp KEEP/pkg_skel/autoconf pkg/my-new-pkg

There are other convenient templates located in `KEEP/pkg_skel/` as well.

Try running `utils/dlinfo.sh`:

	$ utils/dlinfo.sh http://1.2.3.4/my_new_pkg.tar.xz

`utils/dlinfo.sh` will return the file stats and sha512sum for easy copying
and pasting into your new package.

### Package Name Guideline

Package names may consist of the following characters: a-z 0-9 -
i.e: lower-case and numbers only, dash to separate.

Perl5 modules from cpan must be named as perl5-Module-Submodule,
for examples perl5-XML-Parser. Uppercase should be applied exactly
as in the module name.

Python modules must be named as python-module.
example: python-setuptools

Following this convention makes it possible to use package names in
regexes or URLs without having to escape or encode/decode them.

### Package Sources and Philosophy

Sabotage is designed with limited internet availability in mind.
After downloading packages in advance, when you have internet, you may build
later offline at your leisure.

Space considerations are a top issue, both bandwidth and HD image size.
Sabotage ISOs and images ship with all tarballs to fulfill the GPL.
ALWAYS USE a TAR.XZ (preferred) or TAR.BZ2 download URL.

Please do not use FTP mirrors. FTP is a broken, ancient protocol.

Downloads from git or other source repositories are not desired.
This would add an internet connection as a build-time dependency.


## THANKS

Sabotage originally was a distribution curated by chris2, based around shell
scripts and Plan 9's mk.
This was possible through the help and inspiration of
dalias, niklata, garbeam, pikhq, xmw, gaf and Arch Linux.
